# scrapping black owned restaurant from yelp's server

In this research project, I have practiced scrapping data from yelp website
about black owned restaurants using python web crawler. The projects gets useful
information about restaurants like restaurant name, address, city, state,
features, rating (stars), landline (if any), number of reviews,
blacked reviewed restaurants, and whether restaurants are self-identified
black-owned restaurants or not and lastly, whether they provide delivery or
takeout services

# Running the Program

Makes sure to add the python libraries before running the code. The libraries used
in the project were selenium, BeautifulSoup4, time, sqlite3
